# Summary

This is the PIC18F25K50 firmware for Prog, a programmer for selected Microchip PIC16F, PIC18F and PIC32F microcomputers. The programmer is a PIC18F25K50 with associated circuitry that connects to a PC over USB and to the PIC to be programmed. It is controlled from the PC using the [Prog-Win](https://github.com/jhbe/prog-win) command line utility, which reads [HEX files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX). Typically the HEX file would have been generated by one of the (free) Microchip compilers.

Note that the picture above illustrates the Prog chicken-and-egg problem; without access to a preprogrammed PIC18F25K50 you need the programmer to program the programmer PIC.

# Build

This repo is configured for MPLAB-X v3.55 (the free IDE from microchip) and XC v1.41 (a C compiler with a free option). It uses the Microchip MCC.
